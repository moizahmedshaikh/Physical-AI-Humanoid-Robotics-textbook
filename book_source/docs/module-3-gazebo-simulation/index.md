# Module 3: Gazebo & Simulation

Module 3 focuses on robot simulation using Gazebo, a powerful 3D simulator. We will explore its environment, delve into physics simulation and sensor modeling, and discuss potential integrations with other platforms like Unity.

## Chapters in this Module:
*   [Gazebo Simulation Environment](01-gazebo-environment.md)
*   [Physics Simulation and Sensors](02-physics-simulation-sensors.md)
*   [Unity Integration for Robotics Simulation](03-unity-integration.md)

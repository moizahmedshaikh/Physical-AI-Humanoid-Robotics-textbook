# 🤖 Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the most exciting frontier in artificial intelligence! This course bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical embodiment.

## 🎯 Course Focus & Theme
**AI Systems in the Physical World | Embodied Intelligence**

Our goal is simple yet profound: **Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body**. You'll learn to apply AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in both simulated and real-world environments.

## 🚀 Why This Matters Now?

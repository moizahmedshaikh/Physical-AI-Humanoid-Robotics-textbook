## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

The `tasks.md` file for the RAG Chatbot System has been generated, outlining 30 tasks across 6 phases, organized by user stories. It identifies parallel execution opportunities and defines independent test criteria for each story, with an MVP scope on User Story 3 and User Story 1.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully generated `tasks.md` with a comprehensive plan for the RAG Chatbot System.
- 🧪 Tests: None explicitly created as part of this command, but independent test criteria are defined for each user story within `tasks.md`.
- 📁 Files: Created: `specs/001-rag-chatbot/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implement tasks as defined in `tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: Ensured all prerequisite scripts were available before task generation. The `create-phr.ps1` script now correctly generates initial PHR files.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: null
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
